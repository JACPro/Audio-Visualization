# Audio Visualization - Unity Project

A simple audio visualizer that works with any audio file. The incoming sound is parsed and arranged into audio bands. These bands then represent the different frequency ranges you hear (e.g. bass, mids, treble) and can adjust using an equalizer. By manipulating the scale of objects based on the values of these bands each frame, I was able to create a simple bar style audio visualizer.
